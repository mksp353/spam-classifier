**Spam Email Classifier Using Naive Bayes**

**Project Overview**

This project is a machine learning model built to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" using a Naive Bayes classifier. The model is trained using email subjects and labels provided in a CSV file and employs a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier within a scikit-learn Pipeline. The model is saved as a pickle file for future use.


**Dataset**

The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in a CSV file named emails.csv. It contains two columns:

Subject: The subject line of the email.

Label: The classification label, where 1 represents spam and 0 represents not spam.


**Requirements**

To install the required packages, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
